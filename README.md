*singular* is a C++ library which provides functions and classes to perform [singular value decomposition (SVD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition).

The goals of this reinvention are
 - Learning Francis's algorithm
 - Learning modern C++

Prerequisites
=============

You need the following software installed,
 - [CMake](https://cmake.org) 2.8.4 or higher
 - C++ compiler

Getting started
===============

*singular* consists of only header files.
The [CMake script](/CMakeLists.txt) does everything you need to install *singular*.

Please take the following steps,

 1. Clone the repository anywhere you like and move down to it,

	```shell
	git clone https://github.com/kikuomax/singular.git
	cd singular
	```

 2. Configure the project.
    Suppose you want to install *singular* into the directory `install-path`.

	```shell
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install-path ..
	```

 3. Install headers.

    ```shell
	cmake --build . --target install
	```

 4. You will find the headers in the following directory,
     - `install-path/include/singular`

An [example program](/test/test.cpp) shows how to use *singular*.

Testing singular
================

If you have [googletest](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/) installed, unittests for *singular* are built by the CMake script as well.
You can run unittests by the following command after running the build step of *singular*,

```shell
ctest -V
```

Generating documentation
========================

If you have [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) installed, documentation of *singular* is generated by the CMake script as well.
You will find the `api` directory created by CMake.
